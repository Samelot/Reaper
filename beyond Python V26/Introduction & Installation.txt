beyond Python & beyond.Reaper V26
=================================

Dynamic Class, UI, Parallelism, Serialization, Reaper Remote Control 
and Proxy API designed and coded by Büke Beyond.


Installation:
=============

Until there is an Installer, here are some manual steps:

Make sure Python 3.3+ is installed.

Place the beyond Python directory anywhere you prefer.

Edit the "beyond.pth" file and enter the full path to the
"./Modules" directory on the first line.

Copy "beyond.pth" file to 
<Python Path>/Lib/site-packages

For beyond.Reaper, edit:
/Modules/beyond/Reaper/Settings.py 
and follow the steps there.

Run "Test Installation.py".



Introducing beyond.Reaper
=========================

beyond.Reaper is a small API that brings both simpler and unlimited
programming to Reaper Python developers.

With beyond.Reaper, you can run full Python programs outside Reaper
and use its entire API seamlessly like running inside Reaper, but with
additional capabilities that go beyond ReaScript, a subset of Python.

This enables rapid development of sophisticated applications for
Reaper with full UIs, multi-threading, stable access to tkinter, 
and all the other Python modules available.  In addition, programs
can be launched externally to access Reaper only when needed, 
be associated with file types, and be edited and debugged with
advanced tools.

beyond.Reaper also provides simpler and more robust access to Reaper.
Projects, Tracks, Items and all Reaper Data Chunks (Elements) have
easy to use and fast Python models. There is also a highly simplified
UI system available with multi-threading and state saving.

There is only one Reaper Action that needs to be setup:
Modules/beyond/Reaper/RemoteControl.py

When an External program accesses the Reaper API:
import beyond.Reaper
Reaper.OnPlayButton()

behind the scenes, RemoteControl.py is launched as an Action 
via Reaper's OSC. RemoteControl.py instantly connects back to the
external program via TCP/IP and efficiently executes every 
command needed, complete with intricate arguments, returns, 
and relaying of Reaper Exceptions.

To execute a series of calls in one connection:
with Reaper as r:
	A = r.GetTrack(0, r.CountTracks(0) - 1)
	r.OnPlayButton()

This happens very fast.  Any error exception safely closes the 
connection, and even the Undo state is restored.

Of course, you can use beyond.Reaper to program at a higher level:
for T in Reaper.ProjectSelected.TracksSelected:
	Say(T.Name)
	T.Name += " :-)"

beyond.Reaper was designed for performance, succinctness and expressiveness.
